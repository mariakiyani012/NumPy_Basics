## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Array

An array is a central data structure known as the ndarray (short for N-dimensional array). It is a grid of values, all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.

## Array Creation and Initialization

- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Initializing arrays with zeros, ones, and specific values

## Data Types

- Understanding different integer and floating-point types (e.g., int32, float64)
- Selecting appropriate data types based on memory and range requirements

## Array Operations

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Sorting arrays
- Concatenating arrays

## Array Attributes

- Retrieving shape, size, and dimension of arrays

## Indexing and Slicing

- Accessing and filtering array elements using indexing and slicing techniques
- Boolean indexing for conditional filtering

## Matrix Operations

- Creating and manipulating matrices
- Performing matrix-specific operations like slicing, element-wise operations, and aggregation functions

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to NumPy, covering essential features and functionalities. By mastering these fundamental concepts, you'll be well-equipped to handle more complex tasks in data science and machine learning.
